# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Modelling the hypothalamic control of growth hormone secretion.**   
MacGregor DJ, Leng G. _J Neuroendocrinol_ 2005;17(12):788-803
[16280026](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280026) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Here, we construct a mathematical model of the hypothalamic systems that
control the secretion of growth hormone (GH). The work extends a recent model
of the pituitary GH system, adding representations of the hypothalamic GH-
releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin neurones, each modelled as a single
synchronised unit. An unpatterned stochastic input drives the GHRH neurones
generating pulses of GHRH release that trigger GH pulses. Delayed feedback
from GH results in increased somatostatin release, which inhibits both GH
secretion and GHRH release, producing an overall pattern of 3-h pulses of GH
secretion that is very similar to the secretory profile observed in male rats.
Rather than directly stimulating somatostatin release, GH feedback triggers a
priming effect, increasing releasable stores of somatostatin. Varying this
priming effect to reduce the effect of GH can reproduce the less pulsatile
form of GH release observed in the female rat. The model behaviour is tested
by comparison with experimental observations with a range of different
experimental protocols involving GHRH injections and somatostatin and GH
infusion.
